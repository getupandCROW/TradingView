### Signals
- When hi/low limit is getting close on 15M scale, start watching 1M scale to get earliest signs that price is going to change direction.
- Can I view on 1M and set all my indicators to higher time frames so that my signals are more reliable? Or maybe view and setup at higher time frames and then go down to 1M to activate alerts?
- Use the 1H, 4H, day and week views and stick with the uptrending coins only. 100 and 200 MAs show very clear direction
- 10 indicators, each given a score between 1 and 10. If needed, adjustable weight of each indicator in inputs, allowing +/- 3 (7-13) 
    - Once threshold is reached, trailing start, then order is placed.
    - Threshold::  75,80,90?
- Go through my moderately successful past scripts and grab all the indicators that I had working.
- AHK --> trigger by [[@ TradingView]] alert pop up messages --> record message and switch windows --> place conversion order on [[FTXUS]] --> add transaction to [[Airtable]]
