Start with VERY few trade positions and slowly add more to the strategy.

What I have been attempting is to start with LOTS of trade positions and then filtering 
down to reduce the number of bad trades.

Flip the method and begin with only a few, very dependable trades. Then add indicators,
individual bots, etc. 

Maybe the OR statement should be used more. All I use is the AND statement to limit and 
reduce frequency.


1. Build the bot that monitors for major breakout events (like the Dogecoin Pump and Dumps)
across a wide number of coins and scenarios. Be very specific and patient. This bot ONLY 
activates a position in PERFECT conditions with 100% guaranteed and HUGE winning opportunities.
