### Advance/Decline Ratio 

#### Definition

The advance decline ratio shows the number of stocks that closed higher compared to the number of stocks that closed lower. This ratio is calculated using the prior day’s closing prices. The ratio is used to analyze market breadth and determine how strong the market is as a whole.

#### Calculations

The advance decline ratio is calculated by dividing the number of stocks that are advancing  by the number of stocks that are declining.

#### Takeaways

When using the advance decline ratio, keep in mind that it rises when stocks are advancing faster than stocks  that are  declining, and the ratio falls when declining stocks  are reported to have exceeded advances. 

A historically low advance decline ratio potentially shows a market that is oversold, whereas a high advance decline ratio points towards a market that is potentially overbought. The advance decline ratio can be calculated for a variety of time periods, including one day, week, or month.
