## Background  
  
The moving average convergence / divergence ( [MACD](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/macd/) ) indicator is a pulse oscillator that is mainly used to trade trends. Although it is an oscillator, it is not typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions. It appears in the diagram as two lines that oscillate without limits. The crossing of the two lines provides trading signals similar to a system with two moving averages.  
  
The KDJ indicator is a technical indicator used to analyze and predict changes in stock performance and the price patterns of a traded asset. The KDJ indicator is also known as the random index. It is a very useful technical indicator that is most commonly used in short term stock market trend analysis. KDJ is a derived form of the [Stochastic](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/stochastic/) Oscillator Indicator with the only difference that an additional line is called the J-line. Values of% K and% D indicate whether the security is overbought (over 80) or oversold (under 20). The moments when% K exceeds% D are the moments to sell or buy. The J line represents the deviation of the% D value from% K. The value of J can exceed for the% K and% D lines on the graph.  
  
The [Relative Strength Index](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/relativestrengthindex/) ( [RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/relativestrengthindex/) ) developed by J. Welles Wilder is a pulse oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. The [RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/relativestrengthindex/) hovers between zero and 100. Traditionally, the [RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/relativestrengthindex/) is considered overbought when it is above 70 and oversold when below 30. Signals can be generated by looking for divergences and error fluctuations.  
  
Williams% R, also known as the Williams Percent Range, is a type of [momentum indicator](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/momentum/) that moves between 0 and -100 and measures overbought and oversold levels. The Williams% R can be used to find entry and exit points in the market. The indicator is very similar to the [stochastic](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/stochastic/) oscillator and is used in the same way.  
  
The [Directional Movement](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/directionalmovement/) Index (DMI) is an indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder in 1978 to determine in which direction asset prices are moving. The indicator does this by comparing previous highs and lows and drawing two lines: a positive movement line ( [+DI](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/directionalmovement/) ) and a negative movement line ( [-DI](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/directionalmovement/) ). The optional third line is called "Directional Movement ( [DX](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-DX/) )" and it shows the difference between the two lines. When [+DI](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/directionalmovement/) is higher than [-DI](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/directionalmovement/) , the upward pressure on the price is greater than the downward pressure. If [-DI](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/directionalmovement/) is higher than [+DI](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/directionalmovement/) , the price will have greater downward pressure. This indicator can help traders assess the trend direction. Crosses between lines are sometimes used as buying and selling signals.
