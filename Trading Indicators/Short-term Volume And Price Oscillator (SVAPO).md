Short-term [Volume](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/volume/) and [Price Oscillator](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/priceoscillator/) (SVAPO), developed by Sylvian Vervroot, combines both Price and [Volume](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/volume/) to construct an oscillator. In essence, when the price is trending up and [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/volume/) is increasing, [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/volume/) is added into the oscillator calculation. Conversely, when price is trending down and [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/volume/) is increasing, [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/volume/) will be subtracted from the oscillator. During consolidation phases when price and [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/volume/) diverge, [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/volume/) is not used to calculate the oscillator.  
  
### Some notes from his book:  
- A buy is indicated when the oscillator is below the green line but greater than yesterday’s value.  
A sell is indicated when the oscillator is above the red line but less than yesterday’s value.  
- The start of a short term up move is signaled by SVAPO when it turns up from below the lower standard  
deviation boundary. The same is valid for a short term down move when SVAPO turns down from above the  
upper standard deviation boundary.  
- Medium term turning points in an up or downtrend are mostly announced with a divergence between price and  
SVAPO. In a medium term uptrend, SVAPO will generally continue to move above the 0-reference line.

### Vervroot sometimes uses this with his modified %B oscillator:
- [[Vervoort Smoothed Bolinger Bands (VMBB%)]]
